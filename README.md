**If you're using Laravel 4.2.x, please check [branch l4](https://github.com/nikapps/ortc-laravel/tree/l4)**

*This package is based on [nikapps/ortc-php](https://github.com/nikapps/ortc-php).*

## Installation

You can install this [package](https://packagist.org/packages/nikapps/ortc-laravel) by simply run this composer command:

```
composer require nikapps/ortc-laravel
```

Then, add this service provider in your providers array `[app/config/app.php]`:

~~~php
Nikapps\OrtcLaravel\OrtcLaravelServiceProvider::class,
~~~

Then, add this Facade to your aliases array `[app/config/app.php]`:

~~~php
'Ortc' => Nikapps\OrtcLaravel\Facades\Ortc::class
~~~

Next you have to copy the configuration to your connections array `[app/config/broadcasting.php]`:

~~~php
'realtime' => [
    'driver' => 'realtime',
    'credentials' => [

        /*
         * your application key
         */
        'application_key' => 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY',
        /*
         * your private key
         */
        'private_key'     => 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',

    ],
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Real-time REST API Options
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | you can change default options of api.
    |
    */
    'api'         => [
        /*
         * send message
         */
        'send_message'   => [
            'path'               => '/send', //api path
            'max_chunk_size'     => 700, //maximum size of each message in bytes
            'batch_pool_size'    => 5, //pool size for concurrent requests
            'pre_message_string' => '{RANDOM}_{PART}-{TOTAL_PARTS}_' //pre message string format
        ],
        /*
         * authentication
         */
        'authentication' => [
            'path' => '/authenticate' //api path
        ],
        /*
         * url to fetch balancer url
         */
        'balancer_url'   => 'https://ortc-developers.realtime.co/server/2.1?appkey={APP_KEY}',
        /*
         * verify ssl/tls certificate
         */
        'verify_ssl'     => true
    ]
]
~~~


## Configuration

#### Get Application Key & Private Key
First of all, you should register on realtime.co and get your api keys.

* Login/Register at https://accounts.realtime.co

* Create new Subscription 

* You can see your `Application Key` and `Private Key`

* If you want to use authentication, you should enable it in your panel.

#### Update config file

Edit `app/config/broadcasting.php`:

~~~php
/*
* set default broadcasting driver to realtime
*/
'default' => env('BROADCAST_DRIVER', 'realtime'),

'credentials' => [

    /*
     * your application key
     */
    'application_key' => 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY',
    /*
     * your private key
     */
    'private_key'     => 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',

],
~~~

#### Done!

## Usage

#### Get Balancer URL (Manually)

This package automatically get balancer url (best available server), but if you want fetch a new balancer url manually:

~~~php
$balancerUrl = Ortc::getBalancerUrl();

echo 'Balancer Url: ' . $balancerUrl->getUrl();
~~~

#### Authentication
In order to authenticate a user:

~~~php
$channels = [
	'channel_one' => 'w',
	'channel_two' => 'r'
];

Ortc::authenticate(
	$authToken, //authentication token
	$channels,
	$ttl, //(optional) default: 3600
	$isPrivate //(optional) default: false
);
~~~

#### Send Message via broadcasting service (recommend) (Push)
See [laravel/Events - Marking Events For Broadcast](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/events#broadcasting-events)

Below a short example:

Create a new Event
```
php artisan make:event TestEvent
```
Open up app/Events/TestEvent.php and edit
~~~php
<?php

namespace App\Events;

use App\Events\Event;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;

/**
 * Add implements ShouldBroadcast to EventClass
 */
class TestEvent extends Event implements ShouldBroadcast
{
    use SerializesModels;

    /**
     * All public variables will be automatically added to the broadcast payload.
     */
    public $value;
    
    private $userId;

    /**
     * Create a new event instance.
     *
     * @param User $user
     * @param $value
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct(User $user, $value)
    {
        $this->userId = $user->id;
        $this->value = $value;
    }

    /**
     * Get the channels the event should be broadcast on.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function broadcastOn()
    {
        return ['userId_' . $userId];
    }
    
    /**
     * Get the broadcast event name.
     *
     * @return mixed also could be an array
     */
    public function broadcastAs()
    {
        return 'testEvent';
    }
}
~~~

To fire the event:

~~~php
$value = 'test 123';
event(new TestEvent($user, $value));
~~~

The result will be:

~~~json
{
    "event": "testEvent",
    "payload": {
    	"value": "test 123"
    }
}
~~~

#### Send Message manually (Push)
In order to push a message to a channel:

~~~php
Ortc::send(
	$channel, //channel name
	$authToken, //authentication token
	$message //message (string)
);
~~~

*If you are using UTF-8 messages, It's better to use `base64_encode()`.*
